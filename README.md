As regular users of Twitter and citizens who observe different situations in the social media mentioned before. We came to the conclusion that it would be great if we could measure/show the emotions expressed in 140 words by people in this application. 

We propose to develop a driver which will be responsible for downloading and storing the data from Twitter.  
Then, these data would be processed by some algorithm using machine learning ([Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson)) and then stored the results to be consumed and displayed via the web using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

Any aspect of this project can be discussed, the main idea is to learn by having fun while coding.

# **About the Project**
This project aims to demonstrate the importance of words in our era, where anyone is able to create fake or real news, by showing the discrimination and lack of acceptance that each user shows in 140 characters.

The motivation is to learn while having fun coding.
